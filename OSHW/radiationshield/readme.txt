Description

A Stevenson screen is an outdoor shelter for your meteorological sensors, such as those that come along with your electronic home weather station. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) agreed standard for the height of the screen is between 1.25 m (4ft 1 in) and 2 m (6ft 7 in). Its purpose is to provide a standardized environment in which to measure temperature, humidity, dew point and atmospheric pressure. The louvered design allows for the instrument to be sheltered from direct sunlight and rain, yet air is able to flow through the screen unrestricted.

Instructions

Print out one top-part and one bottom-part, and then as many middle-parts as necessary. The parts are designed to snap together (inspired by tbuser's Pin Connectors), so no tools required for assembly. The Stevenson screen is designed to be placed on a pole; one wood-screw and a washer required. The pole in the pictures is a Kelleher 6 ft white vinyl coated closet pole acquired from a local home improvement store.

IMPORTANT: Please print in WHITE color in accordance to the WMO agreed standard.
