# Summary

This is a quick design I've done for a Rain Gauge that can be run from a micro controller such as an ESP8266. The parts uploaded here should be all the mechanical bits required. Adding a small magnet to the middle of the bucket would allow it to be read from a read-relay. Only thing that's left is to do is measure the volume in milliliters (or the unit of your choice) and then increment that rainfall count by that much every time the bucket flops over to the other side.

Note, I have not printed any part of this model yet, but I have validated that it should be printable. Would love to see if anyone prints this model. (I just have to many other projects on the go at the moment to spend more time on this right now). 

There should be enough space inside to add an ESP8266 and a couple of batteries or run a cable from the read relay indoors. I left this bit of detail up to you. Just make sure your funnel/collector is waterproof enough to keep electronics underneath it dry.

Hope this is interesting and/or useful to someone. ;-)

Comments would be much appreciated.
